A fatally injured crew member emerges from the ship and gives Gintoki a strange, clock-shaped device, warning him that it is incredibly powerful and must be safeguarded. Mistaking it for his alarm clock, Gintoki proceeds to smash the device the next morning and suddenly discovers that the world outside his apartment has come to a standstill. With Kagura and Shinpachi at his side, he sets off to get the device fixed; though, as usual, nothing is ever that simple for the Yorozuya team.\n\nFilled with tongue-in-cheek humor and moments of heartfelt emotion, Gintama's fourth season finds Gintoki and his friends facing both their most hilarious misadventures and most dangerous crises yet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"spring","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/53\/Dentsu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1468\/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1258,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1258\/Bandai_Namco_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/21\/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":39486,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/39486\/Gintama__The_Final","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1245\/116760l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"Zn1filVUyf8","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zn1filVUyf8","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Zn1filVUyf8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Zn1filVUyf8\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Zn1filVUyf8\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Zn1filVUyf8\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Zn1filVUyf8\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Zn1filVUyf8\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Gintama: The Final"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"\u9280\u9b42 THE FINAL"},{"type":"English","title":"Gintama: The Very Final"},{"type":"German","title":"N\/A"}],"title":"Gintama: The Final","title_english":"Gintama: The Very Final","title_japanese":"\u9280\u9b42 THE FINAL","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Manga","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2021-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":1,"year":2021},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Jan 8, 2021"},"duration":"1 hr 44 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":9.05,"scored_by":82917,"rank":5,"popularity":1514,"members":175263,"favorites":4555,"synopsis":"Two years have passed following the Tendoshuu's invasion of the O-Edo Central Terminal.
